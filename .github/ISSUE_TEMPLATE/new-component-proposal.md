# <!-- Name of new component -->

* Specifically describe the problem you'd like the new component to solve:

* Are there existing solutions or examples where this component would help?
<!-- You should look around outside the organization at open source projects before making a proposal. Consider if the existing solution with some Faithlife specific styling is actually what we need, or if we must build it from scratch, how can we learn from their API decisions and what we need to solve that they don't -->

* Describe the proposed API:
<!-- List of proptypes are helpful, but existing code with a mock of your proposed component is even better. Examples of consuming code help make sure that we covering as broad a use case as we would need with out including less or extra. -->

* Are there existing specs or designs?

* Do you have additional questions?
